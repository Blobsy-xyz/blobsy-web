## üåä Overview

Blobsy is a blob aggregation analytics and visualization tool designed to help understand and optimize Ethereum blob data. 

**Live Simulation Mode**: Blobsy currently operates in simulation mode, using live blob data and a simple aggregation algorithm to demonstrate the potential benefits of blob aggregation (cost savings, finality improvements) to developers and rollups.

Blob aggregation is currently in early development stage ([blobsy-aggregator](https://github.com/Blobsy-xyz/blobsy-aggregator), [blobfusion](https://github.com/ephema/blobfusion)) and not live yet. This project aims to support efforts from different teams to analyze and visualize aggregated blobs and aggregator services.

## ‚ú® Features

### Backend
- Real-time streaming of Ethereum blobs from Ethereum nodes
- Processing and analysis of blob transaction data
- Detailed blob fee and execution cost estimation

### Frontend
- Real-time blob aggregation simulation using the live blob feed
- Visualization of potential megaBlobs and associated savings
- Detailed breakdown of savings by sender (L2 rollup)
- User-friendly dashboard for monitoring blob metrics

## üöÄ Quick Start with Docker

The default Blobsy setup requires no configuration and works out of the box, leveraging Docker with [PublicNode](https://publicnode.com/) RPC and Beacon API.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Launch Containers

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

The web interface will be accessible at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### Stop Containers

```shell
docker compose down
```
